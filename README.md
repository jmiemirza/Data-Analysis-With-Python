# Data Analysis  
This is Project which I did using some very useful data anaylysis techniques. I have added a report which contains all the details of the solution and also my analysis of the data. The data was provided by Haensel AMS and it was part of a challenge which I was given. All the code is present in a well structured and commented format in *analysis.py*. The report can be found in *Data_Analysis_challenge_Haensel.pdf*.

For this purpose of this project I have used some very useful python libraries such as **Numpy**, **Matplotlib**, **Pandas** and **Seaborn**. The *.csv* files contain the data which has been analysed in the report and the python script.
